### There is much to be learned

this repo contains  the finished  result of what we are going to build together. 
Feel free to clone it. If you want to run the project, install its dependencies and use the command npm start>

## Requirements
to be able to fully grasp react, I recomend you to freshen up on your JS, especially the ES6 features as we will be using them quite a lot. 
Fear not! I will quickly go over some fundamentals. I have some slides about the core definition Javascript to get you started [check it out!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SdM7FdoPiJQECB0lIrkXeqNFszoOpfSQyHVu4cMUJuw/edit?usp=sharing)

Make sure you have node.js and npm installed and  you will be ready to roll!
