        <h2>what is react?</h2>
        <p>
          React is an open source library that revolutionazied the way we code JS. To fully understand its concept, we must take some key words into consideration.
        </p>
        <section className="h3content">
        <h3>A library, not a framework</h3>
        <p>When i started coding, I found it very hard to understand what these two words meant and to be honest, the best way to really understand is by actually using both of them.</p>
        </section>

        <section className="h3content">
        <h3> The burger analogy</h3>
        <p>Surfing the internet I found a very interesting analogy that helped me understand. Let's take  McDonald's and Burger King as the burger makers. Both of them have a specific structure in which they produce their burgers. Because this structure is different in both enterprises, the burgers are significantly different. However they both depend on core elements to produce their burgers like cheese, meat and lettuce.<br/> Translating this to code this we could say that using a framework means that we are bound to work inside a specific structure composed by many predefined elements, modules, libraries, etc. <br/>  when using a library however, we are able to freely compose our working environment ans scale it to fit our needs. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages, depending on what we actually need. </p>

        <h3>JSX</h3>
        <p>JSX is the language of choice when we create react apps. It combines ES6 JS and HTML markup in the same file</p>

        <h3>Is react reactive?</h3>
        <p>Javascript at its core is not reactive, but it has reactive API's (like de  event listener for example). Spread sheets are.</p>

      <section className="workshop-chapter"  id="getStarted">
        <h2>how to get started</h2>
        <p>There are many many ways to set up your working environment when using react thanks to it not being a framework, it is highly customizable and scalable.  encourage you to try out the different methods and also to start from scratch to understand what each file and dependency does. To make things easier for this workshop we will be using one of the most popular package runners for createing a react environment: </p>
        <pre>
        <code>npx create-react-app</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          For this project we will need to install some npm packages
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>npm i gh-pages --save-dev</code><br/>
        <code>npm i react-icons</code><br/>
        <code>npm i react-router-dom</code>
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section className="workshop-chapter" id="folderStructureTour">
        <h2>A tour through the folder structure</h2>
        <p>The npx create-react-app comes with a lot of handy preinstalled dependecies and packages that will help us transpile the code, lint the code and so on> During the workshop we will go over some key features inside this package:</p>
        <section className="h3content">
          <h3>Babel</h3>
          <h3>EsLint</h3>
          <h3>Node modules</h3>
          <h3>Webpack</h3>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section className="workshop-chapter" id="functionalComponents">
      <h2>functional components</h2>
 
        <p>For this project we will use functional components. Thanks to the hooks implementation, we are  able to  get rid of the tedious class components and use functional components. If this is your first time using react and hearing about class components, just now that functional components are the future  as the react team is working towards a react without classes eventually</p>


        <p>You are probably wondering why it matters to use functional components over class components. here is a few of  the reasons</p>
        <section className='bullets'>
        <h3>Easier to read and understand by others</h3>
        <h3>Easier to test</h3>
        <h3>They have the potential to perform better</h3>
        <h3>Easier to debug</h3>
        <h3>Easier to reuse</h3>
        </section>
        <section className="h3content">
          <h3>Functional components</h3>
          <pre>
            <code>
              function Hello(props) &#123;
              return <div>Hello &#123;props.name&#125;</div>
              &#125;
            
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h3>functional component in ES6</h3>
          <pre>
            <code>
            const Hello = (&#123;name&#125;) => <div>Hello &#123;name&#125;</div>
            </code>
          </pre>


          <h3>Class  component</h3>
          <p>This snippet is a contradiction to the most basic rule. If you ever have a class component with only a render method â€“ you should always make it a functional component.</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                class Hello extends Component &#125;

                    render() &#123;
                      return <div>Hello &#123;this.props.names&#125;</div>
                      &#125;
              &#125;
              </code>

      <section className="workshop-chapter" id="hooks">
      <h2>hooks</h2>
      <p>
        To get started with hooks, we we will focus our attention to two of the most used hooks. useEffect() and useState().
      </p>
      <section className="h3content">
      <h3>useState hook</h3>
        <p>
        The core concept of this hook is that whenever our app component renders or re-renders, the useEffecht hook will be invoked.

       This is an exapmple of how to implement useState.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            const [ house, setHouse] = useState('big house');
            <p></p>
            setHouse('small house');
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
         In addition, we can also return a callback function to unmount and clean our effect. To learn more about this you can check what memory leaks are and how to clean after your action in code.
         </p>
         </section>
      <section className="h3content">
      <h3>useEffect hook</h3>
        <p>
        The core concept of this hook is that whenever our app component renders or re-renders, the useEffecht hook will be invoked.

        The useEffect takes two parameters: an anonymous function and a dependency array.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            useEffect(()=>&#123;&#125;,[])
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
         In addition, we can also return a callback function to unmount and clean our effect. To learn more about this you can check what memory leaks are and how to clean after your action in code.

      <section className="workshop-chapter" id="productionBuild">
      <h2>Create a build folder for production</h2>
      <p>For this specific workshop we will be deploying our app on github pages. First things first we need create a repo on github. Then we get into the terminal, we cd into  the project folder we want to deploy and we initialize the git repo. check out this link for more info on   <span><a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-push-an-existing-project-to-github"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how  to intialize a  repository. </a></span></p>
      <p>Once you have your repo on github, install this package if you haven't already:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>npm i gh-pages --save-dev</code>
      </pre>
    

      <p>This is where  you might get a bit confused if it is your first time working with package.json. In there, we need  to add a few lines to be able to run the scripts that will build our production folder and host it to the homepage of our choosing</p>

      <p>On top of </p>
        <pre>
        <code>
        "name": "my app name"
        </code>
        </pre> 
      <p>add this line</p> 

      <pre>
        <code>
          "homepage": "http://yourghlink.github.io/my-app-name"
          </code>
      </pre>

      <p>Inside the existing scripts object, add these two lines. These will build the production folder</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
        "predeploy": "npm run build",
        "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
        </code>
